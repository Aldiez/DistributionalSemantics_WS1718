OOP encapsulates these \"Imparatives\" into smaller packages which can be accessed, reused and performed anytime after instantiation. Using classes and subclasses results in less code which is reduced to the essential operations. This also reduces possibilities of making mistakes __and__ looks more elegant!\n",
